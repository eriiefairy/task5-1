    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a driven and ambitious individual with a strong passion for software engineering. With a Bachelor's degree in BIS Publishing from the University of 
        Pretoria, where I found my love for programming and have developed a solid foundation in technology and a keen eye for detail. Currently, I am actively pursuing my career goal as a software 
        engineer through rigorous coursework at HyperionDev. <br>
        <br>
        In addition to my academic pursuits, I have gained practical experience in various roles. I have honed my customer service and multitasking abilities as a 
        waitress at Juliebean Cafe, ensuring exceptional service and maintaining a positive atmosphere for customers. Simultaneously, I serve as an au pair, 
        nurturing and guiding young minds, which has strengthened my communication and problem-solving skills. Previously, I worked at Crawdaddy's as a waitress 
        and had the opportunity to intern as a horse riding coach. These experiences instilled in me a strong work ethic, adaptability, and effective teamwork. 
        They also reinforced my ability to thrive in dynamic environments and interact with diverse individuals.<br>
        <br>
        My passion for knowledge and commitment to personal growth drives me to excel in the field of software engineering. 
        I am motivated by the prospect of solving complex problems, creating innovative solutions, and contributing to the development of cutting-edge technologies. 
        I strive to leave a lasting impression by delivering high-quality work and continuously expanding my skill set. <br>
        <br>
        In pursuit of my goal, I am eager to apply my technical acumen, creativity, and dedication to a software engineering role. With a focus on continuous learning, 
        I am determined to make a meaningful impact, contributing to the success of teams and organisations in the ever-evolving world of technology.
